              KYN is an innovative and user-friendly application that revolutionized the way people find stores and businesses near them. The app was founded in 2015 by a group of tech enthusiasts with a vision to bridge the gap between consumers and local businesses. Recognizing the increasing need for a convenient and reliable platform, they set out to create an intuitive solution.

In its early days, KYN started as a small directory service, providing users with basic information about nearby stores and businesses. However, fueled by its growing popularity and positive feedback from users, the app underwent significant enhancements and updates.
